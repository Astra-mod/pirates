## Why?

Two reasons:
1. Babel and istanbul were breaking each other.
2. Everyone seemed to re-invent the wheel on this, and everyone wanted a solution that was DRY, simple, easy to use, 
and made everything Just Workâ„¢, while allowing multiple require hooks, in a fashion similar to calling `super`.

For some context, see [the Babel issue thread][] which started this all, then [the nyc issue thread][], where 
discussion was moved (as we began to discuss just using the code nyc had developed), and finally to [#1][issue-1] 
where discussion was finally moved.

[issue-1]: https://github.com/ariporad/pirates/issues/1 "Issue #1"

## Installation

    npm install --save pirates

---

## Usage

Using pirates is really easy:
```javascript
// my-module/register.js
var pirates = require('pirates');

// Instead of messing with require like this:
var old = require.extensions['.js'];
require.extensions['.js'] = function (mod, filename) {
  var compile = mod._compile;
  
  mod._compile = function (code, filename) {
    code = myLib.compileFile(code, filename);
    compile.call(mod, code, filename);
  }
  
  old.apply(this, arguments);
}

// Now you can just do this!:
pirates.addHook(['.js'], function matcher(filename) {
  // Here, you can inspect the filename to determine if it should be hooked or not. Just return a boolean. Files in 
  // node_modules are automatically ignored.
  
  // TODO: Implement logic
  return true;
}, function hook(code, filename) {
  return code.replace('@@foo', 'console.log(\'foo\');');
});
```

## API

### pirates.addHook([exts], [matcher], hook);
Add a require hook. `exts` is optional and defaults to ['.js'], for convenience, if you only want to hook one extension,
you can just pass a string. `matcher` is a function which accepts a filename and returns a boolean indicating if the 
file should be hooked (note: files in node_modules are automatically ignored, regardless of `matcher`). `matcher` 
defaults to always true. `hook` is the actual require hook. It accepts two arguments, the code to 
transpile/instrument/whatever and the filename of the module. It must return the new code of the module.
