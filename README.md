## Why?

Two reasons:
1. Babel and istanbul were breaking each other.
2. Everyone seemed to re-invent the wheel on this, and everyone wanted a solution that was DRY, simple, easy to use, 
and made everything Just Workâ„¢, while allowing multiple require hooks, in a fashion similar to calling `super`.

For some context, see [the Babel issue thread][] which started this all, then [the nyc issue thread][], where 
discussion was moved (as we began to discuss just using the code nyc had developed), and finally to [#1][issue-1] 
where discussion was finally moved.

[the nyc issue thread]: https://github.com/bcoe/nyc/issues/70 "NYC Issue Thread"
[issue-1]: https://github.com/ariporad/pirates/issues/1 "Issue #1"
